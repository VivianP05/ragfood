## ✅ Power BI Details - UPDATED!

**Your Power BI Experience:**

**Source:** Completed Power BI fundamentals course on Coursera

**What You Learned:**
- Data connections and import/transformation
- Basic DAX formulas and calculations
- Dashboard design principles and best practices
- Visualization types and when to use them
- Built practice dashboards with sample datasets during course

**Interview Talking Point:**
> "I completed a Power BI fundamentals course on Coursera where I learned data connections, basic DAX formulas, and dashboard design. During the course, I built several practice dashboards using sample datasets, which gave me hands-on experience with data import, transformations, and visualizations. While my proficiency is still basic, my strong Excel foundation—especially with pivot tables, advanced formulas, and dashboard design—transfers directly to Power BI's data modeling and DAX syntax. I'm currently dedicating 15 hours per week to expanding my proficiency through Microsoft Learn and hands-on projects, and I'm confident I can reach intermediate level within 4-6 weeks."

**Why This Answer Works:**
✅ Specific (Coursera course, not vague "coursework")
✅ Honest (basic proficiency, not exaggerated)
✅ Evidence-based (built practice dashboards)
✅ Transferable skills highlighted (Excel → Power BI)
✅ Learning plan (15 hrs/week, 4-6 weeks timeline)
✅ Confidence + track record (mastered pandas in 2 weeks)
