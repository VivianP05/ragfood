✅ Proven learning agility (pandas 2 weeks) = credible timeline
✅ Strong Excel foundation (5/5) = immediate value delivery
✅ Active learning (started Nov 4) = commitment demonstrated
✅ Recommendation: HIRE WITH 2-WEEK TRIAL (prove learning ability)
```

---

### PATH B2: NO - I Can't Learn Power BI Right Now

#### Step 1: Assess Why
```
Reasons you can't dedicate 15 hours/week:
□ Full-time study commitments (finals, major projects)
□ Full-time work (no spare time)
□ Personal circumstances (family, health)
□ Other: _________________________________
```

#### Step 2: Your Options

##### OPTION 1: Wait Until You Can Learn (RECOMMENDED)
```
Timeline: Wait 1-2 months until you have time
Action: 
□ Don't apply to ICG role yet (Power BI is deal-breaker)
□ Use next 1-2 months to learn Power BI properly
□ Build portfolio dashboard
□ Then apply to similar roles (better prepared)

Benefit: Higher chance of success (8.5/10 vs 6.2/10)
Risk: May miss ICG opportunity (but better fit later)
```

##### OPTION 2: Apply to Non-Power BI Roles (ALTERNATIVE)
```
Look for roles that match your CURRENT skills:
✅ Excel-focused Data Analyst (no Power BI required)
✅ Data Quality Analyst (Excel + SQL only)
✅ Junior BI Analyst (Excel primary, Power BI nice-to-have)
✅ Business Analyst (Excel + data analysis)

Your score for Excel-only roles: 8.5-9.0/10 (STRONG HIRE)
```

##### OPTION 3: Apply to ICG Anyway (RISKY)
```
⚠️  WARNING: Not recommended

Your score if Power BI = none + can't learn:
┌────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  CURRENT:  8.08/10 (CONDITIONAL HIRE)  │
│  NO PBI:   6.20/10 (REJECT)            │
│  CHANGE:   -1.88 points                │
│  CONFIDENCE: 3.0/10                    │
│                                        │
│  STATUS: ❌ LIKELY REJECTION           │
└────────────────────────────────────────┘

Why risky:
- Power BI is REQUIRED (not nice-to-have)
- Can't deliver on core tool immediately
- No credible learning plan = lack of commitment
- Interview will expose gap quickly

Only apply if:
□ You're willing to learn Power BI FAST if offered
□ You can honestly commit to 1 month learning if hired
□ You're okay with potential 2-week trial period
```

#### Step 3: Recommendation for You
```
IF you genuinely can't learn Power BI right now:
→ DON'T apply to ICG (save time, avoid rejection)
→ Look for Excel-only roles (leverage your 5/5 strength)
→ Learn Power BI when you have time (1-2 months)
→ Apply to ICG-type roles THEN (fully prepared)

Your future score (after learning Power BI):
- Excel only roles NOW: 8.5/10 (STRONG HIRE)
- ICG-type roles LATER: 8.95/10 (STRONG HIRE with PBI)

Best strategy: Right role, right time, right preparation
```

## PATH C: Full-Time Availability Assessment

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Can you work full-time Mon-Fri while studying  │
│  (until June 2026)?                              │
└─────────────┬───────────────────────────────────┘
              │
        ┌─────┴─────┐
        │           │
       YES         NO
        │           │
        ▼           ▼
```

### PATH C1: YES - I Can Work Full-Time

#### Document Your Availability
```
ACTION: Update VIVIAN_PROFILE_SUMMARY.md with:
───────────────────────────────────────────────
### Contract Availability

**Full-Time Commitment:**
- Available: Monday-Friday, 9am-5pm (or client hours)
- Study schedule: [Evening classes / Online / Flexible]
- Graduation: June 2026 (contract ends May 2026 - no conflict)
- Location: Sydney-based (no relocation needed)

**Contract Duration:**
- Minimum: 6 months (November 2025 - May 2026)
- Open to extension: Yes (if performance strong, can extend to 12 months)
- Start date: [Immediate / 2 weeks notice / Specify date]

**Balancing Study & Work:**
- Proven track record: Currently balance Bachelor's + Ausbiz internship
- Time management: Strong organizational skills
- Commitment: Contract work is priority during work hours
───────────────────────────────────────────────
```

#### Your Advantage
```
✅ Availability confirmed → No red flags
✅ Graduation June 2026 → Contract ends May 2026 (perfect timing)
✅ Proven ability → Already balance study + internship
✅ This removes major uncertainty from your candidacy
```

---

### PATH C2: NO - I Can't Work Full-Time

#### Assess Impact
```
If you can't work full-time Mon-Fri:
❌ This is DEAL-BREAKER for contract role
❌ ICG needs full-time contractor (not part-time)
❌ Your score drops significantly

New score: 5.5/10 (REJECT - below 7.0 threshold)
```

#### Your Options

##### OPTION 1: Find Part-Time Roles (RECOMMENDED)
```
Look for:
✅ Part-time Data Analyst (20-30 hrs/week)
✅ Freelance Excel consulting
✅ Contract work with flexible hours
✅ Remote roles with flexible schedule

Your score for part-time roles: 8.5/10 (STRONG candidate)
```

##### OPTION 2: Wait Until After Graduation (ALTERNATIVE)
```
Timeline: After June 2026 graduation
Action:
□ Focus on studies now (finish Bachelor's strong)
□ Continue Ausbiz internship (gain more experience)
□ Learn Power BI in spare time
□ Build portfolio projects
□ Apply to full-time roles post-graduation

Benefit: Fully available, higher salary potential
Risk: Miss current opportunity (but better timing later)
```

##### OPTION 3: Negotiate Flexible Arrangement (RISKY)
```
⚠️  WARNING: Unlikely to succeed for ICG contract

You could try:
□ Propose 4 days/week instead of 5
□ Propose remote work for flexibility
□ Propose compressed hours (longer days, fewer days)

Likelihood of success: LOW (10-20%)
- Contract roles need predictable full-time presence
- Client may not allow flexible arrangements
- Other candidates available full-time

Only try if:
□ You have unique skills they desperately need
□ You're willing to accept rejection
□ You have backup plan if they say no
```

#### Recommendation
```
IF you can't work full-time Mon-Fri:
→ DON'T apply to ICG contract role (wrong timing)
→ Look for part-time or flexible roles (better fit)
→ OR wait until post-graduation (June 2026+)
→ Save ICG-type roles for when you're fully available

Timing is key: Right role, wrong time = rejection
Better to wait and apply when fully ready
```
