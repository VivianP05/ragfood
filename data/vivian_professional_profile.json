SITUATION: Client datasets had 15-20% error rates, manual data cleaning consumed 15 hours per week. This time-intensive, error-prone process delayed client deliverables across 3 client accounts affecting 250,000 records. TASK: Automate data cleaning to reduce manual effort and improve accuracy. Responsibilities included profiling 250,000 records across 45 fields, designing automated validation workflows, implementing Python scripts, and documenting processes. ACTION: Analyzed 250k records in weeks 1-2, identified 8 error types (missing values, format issues, duplicates, invalid entries). Categorized by severity (2 critical, 3 high, 2 medium, 1 low). Built Python automation using pandas in week 3 with validation rules, data type checks, format standardization, duplicate detection. Tested on sample datasets (5k, 10k, 50k records) in week 4. Deployed to production in weeks 5-6, automating 80% of recurring errors. Ongoing monitoring and iteration added 3 new validation rules. TECHNOLOGIES: Python, pandas, NumPy, Excel, Git, Jupyter Notebooks. RESULTS: Reduced manual cleaning from 15 to 4 hours/week (70% reduction = 572 hours saved annually), improved accuracy from 85% to 97% (+12 points), automated daily processing of 50,000 records, scripts adopted by 2 team members, 3-day faster deliverable turnaround, critical errors reduced from 5% to 0.5% (90% reduction), enabled handling 2 additional client accounts without hiring.

SITUATION: Senior leadership lacked real-time visibility into data quality metrics across 3 client accounts. Monthly KPI reports took 10 hours to prepare manually, and data was 1-2 weeks outdated by presentation time. TASK: Design and build automated Excel dashboard for real-time KPI tracking. Requirements included interviewing 5 stakeholders, creating 12 KPIs across 4 categories (data quality, processing efficiency, team productivity, client satisfaction), enabling self-service for 15 users, and reducing report prep time by 50%+. ACTION: Week 1 interviewed 5 stakeholders (3 senior analysts, 2 client service managers) for KPI requirements. Week 2 designed dashboard layout with 4 categories, 12 metrics, visual hierarchy. Weeks 3-4 built dashboard using advanced Excel: VLOOKUP, INDEX-MATCH, nested IF, SUMIFS, COUNTIFS, pivot tables, charts (line, bar, pie, gauge). Week 5 automated data refresh with VBA macros, connected 3 client data sources. Week 6 validated with 3 sample months, gathered feedback from 5 test users. Weeks 7-8 trained 15 stakeholders in 2 group sessions, created 1-page user guide, set up monthly presentation schedule. Ongoing monthly insights presentations to senior leadership (15-20 min). TECHNOLOGIES: Excel Advanced, VBA Macros, Pivot Tables, Advanced Formulas, Data Visualization. RESULTS: Used by 15 stakeholders across 3 departments (100% adoption), reduced report prep from 10 to 4 hours/month (60% reduction = 72 hours saved annually), accessed 50+ times per month (3-4 views per user), real-time data vs 1-2 week lag, 100% on-time delivery over 6 months, 4 of 5 stakeholders rated 9/10 or higher, template reused for 3 additional client dashboards, enabled data-driven decision-making for resource allocation.
